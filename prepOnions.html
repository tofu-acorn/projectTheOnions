    <ol>
        <li>Cut one end off an onion. I prefer to cut off the stem end, the one with the little hairs, 
            so that I don't end up with those hairs on my cutting board later.</li><br>
        <li>Place the cut side down on the cutting board and slice the onion through the middle to have 
            two equal pieces.</li><br>
        <li>Now peel the two halves.</li><br>
        <li>Repeat with all onions.</li><br>
        <li>Now, slice the onions into 1/8 inch half moons. As for the thickness of the slice, just aim 
            for 1/8 inch thick and go from there. It's fine if they are larger, just not too large, so 
            try to keep as many of the slices under 1/4 inch thick as you can.
        </li><br>
    </ol>

    <p>Once you are comfortable with slicing the onions, you can speed things up by stopping at step 4 
        (after the peeling, but before the slicing). Add the oil to the pan and turn on the heat. Slice 
        3 onions, and throw them in the pan, mixing to coat in oil. Just repeat, 3 onions at a time, until 
        all the onions are in the pan. Then mix in the salt.</p>
