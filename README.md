My project is intended to teach anyone who wants to cook to cook well. I tried to include recipes that would make a person feel professional, and still be relatively easy, and also inexpensive. I also tried to convey that cooking well comes from practice, dedication, and decent tools, and hoped to imply that it's not something that only certain people are born with. I tried to emphasize vegetables because I believe that many people struggle to make vegetables taste good. I also included an easy way to make whole grains taste good for that same reason. The website I created is actually a simplified version of what I originally intended to do, which was a comprehensive recipe index that also taught the basics of everything from seafood to desserts, from time-temperature control to cross-contamination, ect. But I'm happy that I focused on what it is because I really enjoyed writing it. Plus, with this website, I didn't have to take pictures of a live lobster, which was great because they scare me.
