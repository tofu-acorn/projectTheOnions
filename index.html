        <section id="title">Caramelized Onions: A Chef's Secret</section>
        <section id="leadParagraph">There are many different ways to make caramelized onions. From onion selection, to extra ingredients like sugar and baking soda, 
            to pan selection, there are many choices one has to make. This recipe is a full-proof standard that cooks can use until they feel comfortable to branch 
            out and experiment. The biggest benefit of this recipe is that it is hard to burn and you won't have to baby it by standing at the stove for the duration
             of the cook time. By taste testing during the cooking process, you'll also learn to recognize the flavor nuances of mostly cooked onions and onions that
              have been fully cooked.</section>
