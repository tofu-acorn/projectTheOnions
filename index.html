    <p>
        Several years before I began culinary training, I decided to teach myself to cook. My great grandmother's health was rapidly declining, and I was convinced I could make 
        her healthy again. I started studying the basics of everything I thought I needed to know for better nutrition: phytochemicals, antioxidants, EFA ratios. I compiled lists 
        of foods highest in every vitamin, mineral, and essential amino acid. I branched out into food chemistry and biochemistry, and became obsessed with food politics. And, of 
        course, during all of this, I was cooking. Or, at least, I thought I was cooking. What I really was doing was presenting my grandma with plates of unpalatable whole foods 
        that I had combined because of their nutritional value, and without any knowledge of how to make food taste good. She let me know, though. After the third or fourth time she 
        requested a TV dinner, I started studying cookbooks. 
    </p>

    <p>
        What I eventually figured out is that learning to cook isn't complicated as long as you study the right stuff first. Like learning the differences between the techniques 
        such as boiling, braising, and simmering (and learning why certain techniques are used for certain foods). This part is really simple. Just pick a food you really like, and 
        cook it using several different techniques. If you like baked salmon, try simmering it (actually called steeping for seafood), or broiling it. Like scrambled or boiled egg? 
        Try poaching them in chicken stock, or miso (just crack them into some separated, boiling stock while you're making a soup), or crack them onto a pan of roasted pork steaks 
        for the last 8 - 12 minutes of the pork's cook time (they're ready when they stop jiggling). Try cooking a few of the 
        <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/mother-sauces-996119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mother sauces</a>, and make some small sauces from them 
        (I made hollandaise five days a week for two years, I promise your arm will eventually stop hurting). And always be on the lookout for a secret ingredient, something that 
        you know you can add if a new dish doesn't end up tasting delicious. Hot sauce is an easy one (try Tabasco's chipotle sauce if you haven't yet), and spices or spice blends 
        are simple too (I stir ground garlic and smoked paprika into finished dishes), and, of course, there's always 
        <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-roast-garlic-in-the-oven-5341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roasted garlic</a>. But my favorite ingredient, after all these years 
        of cooking, is still caramelized onions.
    </p>
   
    <p>
        Learning to caramelize onions is a delicious way to expand your cooking skills to a professional level. Not only will these recipes hone your knife skills, and allow you to get 
        comfortable with deglazing, you'll also get to play around with the chemical reactions of caramelization and the Maillard Reaction. And, by taste testing during the cooking process, 
        you'll also learn to recognize the flavor nuances of cooked onions compared to onions that have been caramelized. These skills will help form the foundation of your culinary training. Once 
        the onions are caramelized, you will have an ingredient that will transform most savory meals, whether they're homecooked, take-out, or a microwaved dinner (seriously, mix them 
        into Salisbury steak gravy). Because of their complex flavor, when they are added as an ingredient, caramelized onions will make dishes taste gourmet, even though the onions themselves 
        they are relatively simple to cook. Some of my favorite uses for caramelized onions are discussed on the "How To Use" page.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's worthwhile to do a little studying before starting your first batch of onions. The "Prep Onions" page shows each step needed to get the onions ready for cooking. Also,
        please check the "Equipment" page before caramelizing your onions, as a different pan correlates to each one of the novice, advanced, or expert recipes. Choose your lid and 
        utensil. There is also information about knives and cutting boards.
    </p>
        The onions darken in color because of both the 
        <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/what-is-maillard-reaction-cooking-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maillard Reaction</a> and caramelization. While they are 
        cooking, a brown, sticky substance, called fond, will form on the bottom of the pan once most of the onion liquid has been evaporated. The fond is the result of the chemical 
        reactions mentioned about. This won't be a big issue with nonstick, but with castiron and stainless steel, the fond needs to be controlled, or the onions and oil will taste burnt.
        To control the fond, you'll use a process known as deglazing. While stock or alcohol may be used to deglaze in other recipes, I prefer water for caramelized onions. Whenever the 
        fond builds up on the pan, first check if you can remove it by rubbing some onions over it with the spatula. If it unsticks easily then there's no need to deglaze at the time, the 
        onions are still doing it for you. Once the fond stays stuck however, you will need to dissolve it. To do this, pour a few tablespoons of water right on top of the fond, and quickly 
        use the spatula to scrap it from the bottom of the pan, and back into the onions.
    
    <h1>Which Onions?</h1>

    <p>
        I usually just use a 3 lb bag of yellow onions because they're large. I choose my onions based on size more than anything else because I'd rather peel and prep five or six large onions, 
        as opposed to a dozen little ones. There are several varieties of yellow, and if you want to branch out beyond the giant yellow onions I use, I suggest starting with Bermuda or Vidalia 
        onions.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can use also use white or red onions. If I have a leftover red onion or two that I know isn't going to be used for any other recipe, I just add it to the yellows. The same goes for 
        white onions, and you can definitely caramelize a batch of all white onions. But please be aware that while one or two red onions are nice in a big batch of yellow or white, 
        caramelizing all red onions will lead to a noticable bitter flavor. 
    </p>

    <h1>Which Oil?</h1>

    <p>
        You'll want to use a neutral oil, which is just an oil that doesn't add its own flavor to the caramelized onions. There are a few choices: canola, grapeseed, and vegetable.  I use 
        canola oil for these recipes. I've read that refined avocado oil has an almost neutral flavor, but as I haven't cooked with it yet, I can't say whether or not the flavor will work
        well with caramelized onions. 
    </p>

    <h1>Which Salt?</h1>

    <p>
        At home I only use sea salt, and the salt measurement for each recipe was taken with that sea salt. You do not have to use sea salt, just use whatever you have on hand. Just be aware 
        that if you use a very fine salt, such as table salt (the salt commonly found inside salt shakers), then you'll need to use a little less. 
        <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/ask-the-food-lab-do-i-need-to-use-kosher-salt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is a link to an article that explains the 
        differences, and similarities, of salts. If you're curious, restaurants generally use kosher salt for cooking.
