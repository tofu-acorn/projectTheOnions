        <p>
        Nonstick is my cookware of choice for carmelized onions because of the way it cooks them. Technically, 
        the term for this type of caramelization is called blonding.<aside id="castloc"><img src="images/panCI.jpg" alt="cast iron pan on stove" class="castresize"></aside> 
        If the bottom of the pot does get some brown that can not be easily removed with your spatula, pour a few tablespoons of water over it and
        scrape again. This browning, which accounts for much of the flavor in carmelized onions, isn't usually 
        obvious when using a nonstick pan. If it is, either the heat is too high, or the pan may not be as 
         nonstick as we want. Either way, just deglaze, and turn down the heat a bit, and check every 5 minutes 
         or so until the fond doesn't build so fast.  With cast iron or stainless steel, the browning has to be 
         carefully controlled throughout most of the recipe by deglazing and scraping. If it isn't, the fond 
         will burn and then the onions and oil will just taste burnt.  This is why using nonstick with this 
         recipe is great for beginners. It also allows you to practice the cutting, cooking, and time management 
         processes with no real risk of having to throw away a time-consuming recipe. The flavor will be less 
         intense, but it's still amazing.

            Although a nonstick pot is used in this recipe, a large nonstick skillet will work just fine. If the 
            onions don't fit in the skillet all at once, just add the oil and half of the onions. Set the heat 
            to medium-high, and set a lid on top of the skillet (it's okay if the lid sits on the onions). Cook 
            the onions down for about 10-25 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes and adding more onions until they 
            all fit. This may shorten the overall cooking time, which is fine, because you'll choose how long to 
            cook the onions near the end of the recipe.
