    <h1>Pot/Pan</h1>
    <p id="head">The Recipes - Novice (Nonstick)</p>
        <p>
        Nonstick is my cookware of choice for carmelized onions because of the way it cooks them. Technically, 
        the term for this type of caramelization is called blonding.<aside id="castloc"><img src="images/panNS.jpg" alt="cast iron pan on stove" class="castresize"></aside> 
        If the bottom of the pot does get some brown that can not be easily removed with your spatula, pour a few tablespoons of water over it and
        scrape again. This browning, which accounts for much of the flavor in carmelized onions, isn't usually 
        obvious when using a nonstick pan. If it is, either the heat is too high, or the pan may not be as 
         nonstick as we want. Either way, just deglaze, and turn down the heat a bit, and check every 5 minutes 
         or so until the fond doesn't build so fast.  With cast iron or stainless steel, the browning has to be 
         carefully controlled throughout most of the recipe by deglazing and scraping. If it isn't, the fond 
         will burn and then the onions and oil will just taste burnt.  This is why using nonstick with this 
         recipe is great for beginners. It also allows you to practice the cutting, cooking, and time management 
         processes with no real risk of having to throw away a time-consuming recipe. The flavor will be less 
         intense, but it's still amazing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although a nonstick pot is used in this recipe, a large nonstick skillet will work just fine. If the 
            onions don't fit in the skillet all at once, just add the oil and half of the onions. Set the heat 
            to medium-high, and set a lid on top of the skillet (it's okay if the lid sits on the onions). Cook 
            the onions down for about 10-25 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes and adding more onions until they 
            all fit. This may shorten the overall cooking time, which is fine, because you'll choose how long to 
            cook the onions near the end of the recipe.

        <p id="head">The Recipes - Advanced (Cast Iron)</p>

        <p>
            I really love cooking with cast iron, and caramelized onions are always the first thing that I cook in a 
            new cast iron pan.<aside id="castloc"><img src="images/panCI.jpg" alt="cast iron pan on stove" class="castresize"></aside>
            If you've never cooked in cast iron before, but would like to learn the pan, I recommend a recipe 
            such as caramelized onions, or something deep fried. Both of these types of recipes are heavy on the oil, and will season 
            the pan while cooking, as well as protect the food from burning (more on this below). 
        </p>
        <p>
            As for this caramelized onion recipe, it's harder to see the brown fond when it builds on the black cast iron, but you'll 
            know its there b/c you'll also have bits of onions that are sticking too. Cast iron tends to release the food and fonds 
            easier than stainless steel, so you probably won't need the water every time you stir the onions, but keep a glass close 
            by so that you don't have to run back and forth to the sink.
        </p>

        <p>
            The metal of cast iron (unless it was made back in the day, and therefore polished), is porous and not smooth, which is 
            apparent from its look and feel. When you heat oil in cast iron over very high heat, or lower heat over a longer period of 
            time, that oil breaks down into smaller chains of molecules that then begin to polymerize, or recombine into different, larger
             molecular chains. The cool thing about this process is that when it takes place on top of cast iron, the newly created oil 
             polymer doesn't just bond with itself, it also bonds with the cast iron. This essentially means that with cast iron, some 
             oil, and some heat, you can make a DIY nonstick coating that is resistant to dish soap, rust, and food. This process is 
             known as seasoning the cast iron. While you can do this any time you feel like it by rubbing oil onto clean cast iron, and 
             sticking it in a 450 degree oven for an hour, you can also do this while cooking. Many techniques and dishes will season 
             the cast iron while cooking: frying chicken, searing meat, baking cornbread, and, fortunately for us, caramelizing onions. 
             Caramelizing onions is a great way to break in new cast iron.

        <p id="head">The Recipes - Expert (Stainless Steel)</p>

        <p>If you own or bought some stainless steel cookware only because you thought it would be easier to cook on, or take care of, 
            than cast iron, then I have some bad news:<aside id="castloc"><img src="images/panSS.jpg" alt="cast iron pan on stove" class="castresize"></aside> not only does stainless steel need to be seasoned just like cast iron, it's also 
            a lot easier to burn the food that you are cooking on stainless steel. I'm not sure why the myth of no-season stainless-steel
             persists, but I promise you that if your stainless steel seems less nonstick than the first time that you cooked with it,
              then seasoning will fix it. Yes, stainless steel is easier than cast iron, but that's mainly because it's incredibly resistant 
              to rust.
        </p>

        <p>
            That fond that I keep talking about? With a stainless steel pan, you'll be dealing with that pretty much constantly after most 
            of the onion liquid has evaporated. It's best to keep a glass of water for deglazing at hand while you cook.
        </p>

        <p>
            Stainless steel is a poor conductor of heat, but so is cast iron. This is something you will probably read, so let me explain it. 
            Stainless steel and cast iron accept heat from the stovetop exceptionally well, but neither spread it evenly (neither pan can make every square
             inch of itself the same temperature). Cast iron will heat food more evenly than stainless steel, but this is 
             only because cast iron retains heat so well. This just means that when the parts of a cast iron pan that isn't directly touching a flame or an electric
             spiral coil finally absorb some heat from the parts that touch the flame/coil, they do not let that heat release easily. Cast iron just spreads it better
             because it holds onto the heat.
             Stainless steel, on the other hand, will just releases that heat right back into any place that will accept it. And since parts of the stainless steel pan will
             be cooler because stainless steel doesn't retain heat well like cast iron, it will keep sending heat to a place where it is easily lost, generally to the 
             food or atmosphere or the metal stove. So, stainless steel is pretty terrible unless it has a copper core. (Copper is the best element we have
             for heat absorbtion and transfer, but it's not really priced for home cooks or the majority of restaurants.) But if you've watched a few cooking 
            shows or been inside a restaurant's kitchen, you've probably noticed that chefs use stainless steel often. This is because 
            experienced cooks cook intuitively, and will naturally adjust the food and heat if there are signs of the food heating too 
            quickly or slowly, whereas a beginner usually needs to follow a recipe to gain that intuition. The best way to learn to cook 
            intuitively is to practice a recipe consistantly several times, and because caramelized onions are so versatile, it's a perfect 
            recipe to help you learn your pan.
