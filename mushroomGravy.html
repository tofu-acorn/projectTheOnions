        <p>This isn't a traditional gravy. It's a big mess of onions and mushrooms with enough water and oil to work like a gravy. 
            If you would like a more traditional meat-tasting gravy, omit the soy sauce and replace the water with chicken or beef 
            stock. <p>If this seems like too many onions, think of it as a good representation of how one vegetable can be completely 
            transformed through different cooking methods and times.</p>
        </p>
        <p>If you feel comfortable enough to make homemade mashed potatoes alongside this recipe, please do. This recipe isn't 
            complicated once you get the hang of it. I don't do homemade because over the years of cooking in restaurants
            I have made thousands of pounds of mashed potatoes, and now I just can't bring myself to do it in my own kitchen.

        <ol>
            <li>Add the oil to the cast iron, set the stovetop to medium, and allow the pan to heat for a minute or two.</li><br>
            <li>Add the mushrooms, but don't stir (mushrooms are greedy when dry, and they will soak up all the oil, forcing you to add more). 
                Just push them around so that they cover the whole bottom of the cast iron. Allow them to cook for 10 minutes to get a bit of color, 
                and then stir well enough to coat them in the oil.</li><br>
                <img src="images/mush1.jpg" alt="Picture of Mushrooms after 10 minutes of cook time" class="center"><br>
            <li>Cook another 10 minutes and stir again. Deglaze the pan with a few tablespoons of water, then add the onions, plus 1/3 of the garlic, and stir until everything is mixed.</li><br>
            <img src="images/mush2.jpg" alt="Picture of Mushrooms after 10 minutes of cook time" class="center"><br>
            <li>Continue cooking for 15 minutes while stirring at 5 minute intervals, and deglazing when neccessary.</li><br>
            <img src="images/mush3.jpg" alt="Picture of Mushrooms after 10 minutes of cook time" class="center"><br>
            <li>Add 2 cups water, and half of the remaining garlic. Turn heat to medium-high to begin reducing the vegetables and water. Continue cooking for 15 minutes while stirring at 5 minute 
                intervals, just like the step above.</li><br>
            <li>Add the last of the garlic, and continue cooking and reducing for 10 minutes. If almost all the liquid evaporates during this time, add 1/2 cup water. You want to have at least some 
                liquid in the pan to contribute to the gravy.  Below is an example of just enough liquid. You can always add more in 1/2 cup measurements. Just don't turn it into a soup. </li><br>
                <img src="images/mush5.jpg" alt="Picture of Mushrooms after 10 minutes of cook time" class="center"><br>
            <li>Use the remaining time to prepare the instant potatoes.</li><br>
            <li>After 10 minutes, stir in 1 teaspoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, and 3/4 cup caramelized onions. </li><br>
            <li>Mound the potatoes in a bowl, and using a spoon, press the potatoes toward the edges of the bowl to make a crater. Pile the mushroom gravy into the center</li><br>
