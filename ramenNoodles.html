    <p>Boiling vegetables may seems a little boring, but this recipe will help you learn the differences between al dente vegetables and 
        boiled vegetable mush. It's a bit tricky, because when you use heat this high, there isn't a lot of time to wait for a vegetable 
        to cool enough to taste test it for doneness. To speed up a taste test, pull out the vegetable with tongs, a fork, or slotted spoon, 
        then run it under the faucet (or plunge it into a glass of ice water) until it's cool enough to eat. The three vegetables I use here 
        consistently cook well with a 3-minute pack of noodles. When you begin experimenting with other vegetables (and eventually, other 
        pastas) if you find that the vegetables are already too cooked to handle the extra noodle time, just pull them out with a slotted 
        spoon and set aside. One of the things I like about this recipe is that you eat the liquid that the vegetables are cooked in, but if 
        certain vegetables are giving you trouble, then there is no reason that you can't cook them separately. Just mix them into the pot 
        after you've turned off the stovetop.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Slice the celery and carrots about 1/4 inch thick, checking a ruler if you are unsure (I actually have a kitchen-dedicated 
                ruler hanging close to my cutting board). If you hold your knife at an angle of about 60-degrees, you'll get a nice diagonal 
                cut (also called bias cut) that makes the carrots and celery a bit longer and fancy-looking. This isn't necessary for this 
                recipe as the cooking method is boiling, but it's good to know and practice, especially for recipes that require a wok for 
                the cooking method.</li>
            <li>Cut away the large vein from each cabbage leaf (it's usually too thick to fully cook in this recipe), discard it, and slice 
                the cabbage into ribbons about 1/8 inch thick. Place the prepped vegetables in a large pot, along with 1/2 of the Ramen noodle
                flavor packet, and use cool water to cover the vegetables. You'll need about 1/2 inch of water above the top of the vegetable 
                layer.</li>
            <li>Turn your stove burner to high, and wait until the water comes to a boil. Prep the ramen noodles by cracking them into shorter 
                pieces: hold the unopened package in both hands and crack it right through the middle. Turn the package 45 degrees and crack 
                through the middle again. Open the package and lay the four squares of noodles on the cutting board. Take one of the squares 
                and separate the two halves. Repeat with the other 3 squares. There should now be 8 noodle blocks.</li>
            <li>Once the water begins to boil, drop in your Ramen noodles. Without mixing or disturbing the vegetables, poke the noodles down 
                into the water with a spoon or fork (be careful of the steam) for about 30 seconds, or until they soften and spread out so that 
                they are fully emersed in the boiling water. Continue cooking the vegetables and noodles for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the stove. Add the other half of the Ramen seasoning pack and mix well. Now add the carmelized onions. 1/4 of a cup 
                will give you a nice flavor, but you can add as much as you like. The heat in the soup will warm them up just fine. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
