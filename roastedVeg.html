        <section id="title">Roasted Vegetables with Wild Rice and Caramelized Onions</section>

        
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>Use any grain you want. If you don't have any leftover grains but still want one, you will have about 45 
            minutes until the vegetables are finished, and that time does not include prep or preheating. I use wild 
            rice here, and depending on the variety, it takes about 1.5 hours to cook, so it was leftover. Quinoa, on 
            the other hand, takes about 20 minutes after the water boils. 
        </p>
      
        <p>Regarding which vegetables to choose, I can't think of a single vegetable that doesn't benefit from roasting,
           so please use whatever you like. Just keep in mind that you'll need to mix and match times. Asparagus only
           takes about 15-25 minutes (depending  on the thickness), while the large carrots I use here cooked for 45 
           minutes. Be aware that the cutting the vegetables can make a big difference, such as roasting potato wedges 
           compared to baking a whole potato. Just google the vegetable, note the time, and to be extra safe, check on 
           the vegetables while they are cooking: 15 minutes for delicate ones like asparagus or frozen thinly sliced 
           peppers, 25-30 for heartier vegetables like carrots. Use a fork or tongs to pull a bit of the vegetable out 
           of the oven and inspect it. Once you've practiced roasting vegetables several times, you'll begin to get a 
           feel for it. Don't be afraid to open that oven door, a few extra minutes of cook time from temperature loss 
           is preferable to tossing out burnt vegetables.</p>

        <p><br><h1>Instructions</h1></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees, and line two sheet trays (better known as baking sheets, or cookie sheets) with aluminum foil. You can also 
                cook directly on the sheet trays, but it's a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li>Carrot prep: cut the hard nub off of the top of the carrot, and then leave the carrot whole, and place on one side of a foiled sheet tray. If the greens are 
                still attached, here is an <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/breaking-the-myth-of-whether-or-not-you-can-eat-carrot-tops-tips-from-the-kitchn-121158">article</a> 
                of how they can be used instead of tossed.</li>
            <li>Broccoli and Cauliflower prep: open both bags and dump one out on the left side of a foiled pan, and one out on the right side. Remove any big
                 pieces of ice, and if there are lots of small  ice bits, don't worry about them. They will just evaporate in the oven. Try to keep the 
                 broccoli and cauliflower seperate because, depending upon the manufacturer, broccoli florets can sometimes be small, and they might need 
                 to be removed with a spatula or tongs before the cauliflower is finished. See the note on frozen broccoli below if you accidently bought chopped 
                 broccoli.</li>
            <li>Onion prep: cut both ends off the onion, peel, and place one of the cut sides down on the cutting board. Slice through east-to-west, and then 
                north-south, for four equal portions. If it's a very large onion (like getting close to soft-ball size) you may need to make two more cuts, this time 
                diagonally, for 8 equal pieces. Try to pick the whole onion up as one solid piece, and then set it down on one side of a foiled sheet tray.</li>
            <li>I use disposable gloves for this step, but you can always just wash your hands before and after. Pour some oil over the carrots and the top of the
                 onion, and then over the frozen broccoli and cauliflower. Pick up each carrot and oil it from top to bottom, then move onto the onions. Rub the 
                 oil on the top, and on the rounded sides, and then move the whole onion around on the foil to get some of the oil on the bottom of the onion too. Now 
                 flip each onion piece over on its rounded edge, so that the thin tip points toward the ceiling. Run your oiled fingers on both sides of each piece, 
                 taking care to not break them up. If they start to break apart then you can restack them, but just do your best, and if they fall completely apart then just cut them larger 
                 next time. As for the broccoli and cauliflower, just work your hands around them like you're giving them a massage. It's difficult to actually see 
                 how much oil is on them because on the ice, but if you massage them they will get coated.</li>
            <li>Take off your gloves/wash your hands and sprinkle salt over the vegetables. A very light sprinkle is just fine, maybe about 1/4 teaspoon. You only 
                need the salt on one side, so place both sheet trays in the oven. I only have one rack in my oven so I place them side by side, and if this is your 
                situation also, but they don't seem to fit, try to push the rack back against the oven and that should give you a little more clearance.</li>
            <li>Set the timer for 25 minutes, to be extra safe (see explanation above and pictures below) and your vegetables are roasted when they look like the 
                picture below. For my oven, it was 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix your carmelized onions and leftover grain, and warm them however you'd like (stovetop, microwave, ect.) right before the vegetables are ready. 
                Portion everything onto plates or in a bowl, and serve.</li>
            <br>
            <li><i>NOTE ON FROZEN BROCCOLI</i> If you accidently bought chopped broccoli instead of florets, and the pieces are really tiny, refoil the sheet 
                tray with two seperate foil squares that fit side by side. Just use the inside edges of the sheet tray to shape both pieces of foil so that all 
                four of their edges stick up at least 1/2 inch. This will help avoid any oil spills. Chopped frozen broccoli won't last much longer than 25-30 
                minutes in the oven, so you'll need to pull it out of the oven around that time. To do this, set the whole sheet tray on the stove top, grab 
                one corner of the foil square with tongs or a pot holder, and slide the foil carefully onto a plate. Put the sheet tray back in the oven so the 
                cauliflower can finish cooking.</li>
