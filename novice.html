<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<section>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lbs onions, yellow preferred</li>
        <li>1/4 cup oil, more if you want extra oil for other recipes</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<h1>Instructions</h1>
<section>
    <ol>
        <li>After prepping your onions, turn the stove top to medium-high, and add
            the oil. Add about half of the onions along with the salt, and stir well.
            Now, add the rest of the onions, and stir again until they are
            well coated in oil and salt.</li><br> 
        <li>Cover the pan, but leave the lid askew. Turn the heat down to medium low, and cook 
            for 30 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>After 30 minutes, carefully remove the lid to
            avoid the steam. Stir the onions well, and turn heat to low. Cook,
            uncovered and undisturbed, for another 30 minutes. <i>NOTE: If there is a lot
            liquid (over 1/2 inch) left in the pan, just cook uncovered at medium-high for
            about 15 minutes before setting the 30 minute timer for this step.</i></li><br>
        <li>Stir the onions well, and
            set a few aside to cool. They should now be soft and just a little golden.
            Continue cooking for another 30 minutes. <i>NOTE: Once cool, taste the onions. They
            aren't finished, so you will still taste some rawness. Note this flavor, as it
            will help you get a feel for how much longer future batches need to cook.</i></li><br>
        <li>Stir the onions, and do another taste test. By now the onions should have cooked
            long enough to be somewhat golden. This will really depend on the pan and the
            temperature, so if your onions don't have a deep, sweet flavor, just cook for
            another 20 minutes and taste them again. You can repeat this step many times at 20 - 30 minute intervals
            for a deeper and sweeter flavor. I was happy with mine at this point, and removed them from the heat. <i>NOTE: If your onions are transulent and
            white, and don't taste very good, then the heat isn't high enough. Turn the heat
            up to medium high until they begin to sizzle, then drop the heat back down to
            low. Now increase the heat higher than what you've been using over the last
            hour, about 1 mark on an electric stove. For gas stoves, just raise the
            flame height about 1/8 of an inch. Now, begin cooking at 20 - 30 minute intervals, taste testing each time, until you enjoy the flavor.</i></li><br>
