Instructions *1* After prepping your onions, turn heat to medium-high and add
the oil. Add about half of the onions along with the salt and stir well for
about 10 seconds. Now add the rest of the onions and stir again until they are
well coated in oil and salt. NOTE: Once you are comfortable with your knife and
prepping the onions, you can slice a few and then put the pan and oil on the
heat. Just continue slicing and adding the onions as you go, and every three
onions or so give them a good stir. Italiacs, maybe? *2* Cover the pan, but
leave the lid askew. Turn the heat down to medium low, and cook for 30 minutes.
NOTE: This heats the onions from the top down, which will expel their liquid
quicker. Leaving the lid askew will allow the liquid to evaporate. If you don't
have a lid, you can set a cookie sheet or an oven-safe frying pan partially over
the pan. Aluminum foil will work here too, just shape the foil over the pan and
then pull two of the sides a few inches away from the edges. Please remember to
do this before the pan is hot. *3* After 30 minutes, carefully remove the lid to
avoid the steam. Stir the onions well, about 20 seconds, turn heat to low. Cook,
uncovered and undisturbed, for another 30 minutes. NOTE: If there is a lot
liquid (over 1/2 inch) left in the pan, just cook uncovered at medium-high for
about 15-20 minutes before moving to this step. *4* Stir the onions well, and
set a few aside to cool. They should now be soft and just a little golden.
Continue cooking for another 30 minutes. NOTE: Once cool, taste the onions. They
aren't finished, so you will still taste some rawness. Note this flavor, as it
will help you get a feel for how much longer future batches need to cook *5*
Stir the onions, and do another taste test. By now the onions should have cooked
long enough and be slightly golden. This will really depend on the pan and the
temperature, so if your onions don't have a deep, sweet flavor, just cook for
another 30 minutes and taste them again. NOTE: If your onions are transulent and
white, and don't taste very good, then the heat isn't high enough. Turn the heat
up to medium high until they begin to sizzle, then drop the heat back down to
low. Now increase the heat higher than what you've been using over the last
hour: about 1 1/2 marks on an electric stove. For gas stoves, just raise the
flame height about 1/8 of an inch. Check the onions every 20 minutes or so and
taste test Check Pan Selection here for more information.
