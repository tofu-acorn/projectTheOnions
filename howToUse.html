    <p>Explain why caramelized onions are awesome before the list of uses</p>
    <h4>The extra oil</h4>
    <p>Explain that if the oil tastes weak (closer to unused oil out of a bottle) then use it with abandonment to cook with, but if it tastes strong
        then use it as a flavoring agent, like replacing the oil in homemade salad dressings, or hummus. Explain that no matter if the flavor is weak or strong,
        always adjust for the added salt.
    </p>
    <h4>Toppings and Mix-Ins</h4>
    <p>honey mustard, mayonnaise, deviled eggs (if you dont want to chop, a few buzzes with an emulsifier would be awesome, but use less), </p>
    <h4>Freezing</h4>
    <p>Once cooled, caramelized onions can be frozen. Freezing and thawing won't change the texture significantly, and the flavor will just as delicious. You can freeze them in an ice cube tray
        for individual servings.</p>
