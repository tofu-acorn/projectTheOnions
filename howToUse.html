</header>

<section id="">
    <h4>Storing and Freezing</h4>
    <p>Caramelized onions will transform the flavor of everything you put them in or on. They store well if covered and placed in the refrigerator for up to a week.
        Of course, you can make them once a week, they are absolutely worth the time and the tears required, and you'll hone your knife skills to boot, but 
        this can quickly start to feel like a chore. A great solution is to just freeze them. Freezing and thawing won't change the texture significantly, and the 
        flavor will just as delicious. An ice cube tray will freeze small, individual portions, which allows you to add a couple of tablespoons at a time. Just
        be aware that the onion flavor may permeate the tray even after washing, and as I assume you don't want to drink onion-infused iced tea, you won't
        want to use that tray for regular ice cubes again. I like freezing them in 4 oz mason jelly jars, but zipper sandwich bags work well. Just place the bag on a plate, 
        or in a cup, until frozen, just in case it leaks.
    </p>
    <h4>The extra oil</h4>
    <p> Extra caramelized onion oil is a delicious addition to recipes. I prefer to use it without any extra cooking as a flavoring agent for finished dishes, or in
        uncooked dishes that call for oil, such as salad dressing, or hummus.

        While you can cook with it for quick recipes, such as grilled cheese or eggs, be careful cooking with it for extended periods because it will become bitter. Always 
        remember to adjust for the salt that is already incorporated into the caramelized onion oil.

        If you find that you like this oil, and want extra, just add as much as you want to have leftover to the oil that the caramelized onion recipes call for.
        It doesn't change anything except give you extra.

    <h4>Toppings and Mix-Ins</h4>
    <p>There are so many of these, so I'll just list the ones I make consistantly: honey mustard, mayonnaise, deviled eggs (if you dont want to chop
        the onions into small pieces just use an emulsifier, or stick blender. On top of hot dogs, or hamburgers, or deli meat sandwiches (toast the bread and put the onions in
        between the slices to give them a bit of warmth. Add them to cornbread before baking, or after as a topping instead of butter or jam. Heat them up and toss them with 
        lettuce to slightly wilt the greens for a warm salad</p>

    <h4>Grains</h4>
    <p>
        If you've ever been interested in adding more whole grains to your diet, or just wished that they tasted better, then adding caramelized onions
        will make a perfect addition. I'm not going to cover corn or oats here, although if you cook your oatmeal with only a little salt like I do, then you
        may want to try mixing the caramelized onions with oat groats. The main grains that most people have access to are the rices: Arborio (used for risotto), brown, and white are 
        the most common, and caramelized onions are wonderful in these. We also have several other grain options available, and if you've never ventured
        beyond rice, oats, and corn, then I would recommend starting with quinoa. It cooks very fast, expecially compared to rice, has a nice flavor,
        comes in several varieties, and is amazing mixed with caramelized onions. Wild rice is a delicious option also, but it has a very long cook time,
        even longer than brown rice (by the way, wild rice is actually a grass, not a rice), so be prepared for that. You can also choose from barley, millet, amaranth, and buckwheat. 
        Of course, there are other grains, such as tef and spelt, but as I've never cooked these I don't feel qualified to write about them.
    </p>
    <p>These are a good chunk of your whole grain options, and here's how I recommend cooking them. Replace the water needed with chicken stock, and once the grains have
        cooked and rested for a few minutes, add 1/2 teaspoon of real butter (I use unsalted because that's what I always have on hand) per cup of cooked grain.
        The chicken stock adds great flavor, and the butter makes the grain seem less astringent. Next, add about 1/4 cup caramelized onions per cup of cooked
        grain. If you feel like the added butter is a too little heavy for a recipe that already has caramelized onion oil, then just leave it out.
    </p>
    <h4>Eggs</h4>
    <p>
        A quiche (pronounced KEYSH), a frittata (also known as a farmer's omelette), or an omelette are all excellent choices to add caramelized onions to. I usually cook frittatas as 
        they don't require a crust (like a quiche), or use an extra pan to heat the filling first (like an omelette). If you like eggs, but never tried a frittata, I recommend looking 
        up a few recipes. You basically cook all of your ingredients first (I usually use sausage, any bell pepper except green, and caramelized onions), and then dump cheese and raw scrambled
         eggs over top. Then you bake it at 400 degrees for 10 - 15 minutes (or until the eggs are set) into something that is cut like a pizza slice to serve. There are many, many variations 
         of fritatta recipes on the internet, but my recommendation when reading them is to keep it simple (you don't really need milk or cream, especially when adding cheese), keep it cheap 
         (you don't have to spend $6-$18 on fresh herbs, that's just ridiculous), and don't forget that dinner leftovers work great here since they only need to be reheated. If I had brined 
         pork steak and roasted broccoli as leftovers from dinner, I would absolutely use that pork, the broccoli, some caramelized onions, and some cheese to make a frittata.
    </p>

    <h4>Homemade Pizza</h4>
    <p>
        A good crust will make a homemade pizza really simple. I haven't tried any store-bought varieties, so I can't make a recommendation, but I know there are several available (I usually make a crust 
        out of <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-polenta-crust-pizza-249792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">polenta</a>). The main reason I bring this up is because you can use caramelized onions, and their oil, as a pizza sauce. You can also mix them into a tomato or alfredo sauce for 
        extra flavor, and use that for a sauce. Just spread the caramelized onions, or onion-mixed sauce, on the dough and then add your toppings. Don't forget that carmelized onions can also be used as a topping. 
        Bake according to the store-bought crust's directions.
