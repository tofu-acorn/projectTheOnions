    <h4>Storing and Freezing</h4>
    <p>Caramelized onions will transform the flavor of everything you put them in or on. They store well if covered and placed in the refrigerator for up to a week.
        Of course, you can make them once a week, they are absolutely worth the time and the tears required, and you'll hone your knife skills to boot, but 
        this can quickly start to feel like a chore. A great solution is to just freeze them. Freezing and thawing won't change the texture significantly, and the 
        flavor will just as delicious. An ice cube tray will freeze small, individual portions, which allows you to add a couple tablespoons at a time. Just
        be aware that the onion flavor may permeate the tray even after washing, and as I assume you don't want to drink onion-infused iced tea, you won't
        want to use that tray for ice cubes again. *TEST FREEZING IN GLAD BOWL AND PLASTIC-WRAPPED PLATE*

    <h4>The extra oil</h4>
    <p>Explain that if the oil tastes weak (closer to unused oil out of a bottle) then use it with abandonment to cook with, but if it tastes strong
        then use it as a flavoring agent, like replacing the oil in homemade salad dressings, or hummus. Explain that no matter if the flavor is weak or strong,
        always adjust for the added salt.
    </p>
    <h2>Soup</h2>
    <p>I first learned to cook caramelized onions as an ingredient for French Onion Soup, which is a delicious and beautiful soup, but a bit complicated
        and a little heavy on the booze. It is absolutely worth learning to make, however, I have a few soup ideas that are much more simple, cheap, and
        quick.
        <h4>Ramen Noodles with Vegetables and Caramelized Onions (1-2 servings)</h4>
        <p>You'll need to add enough water into a pan to cover your vegetables and mostly cover the noodles. I like to use 2-3 raw cabbage, 1-2 carrots, and 1-2 pieces of celery
            per pack of Ramen noodles in this, but use whatever you like (see the note at the end). And you'll need at least 2 tablespoons of your 
            caramelized onions</p>

            <p>Thin slice the celery and carrots at about a quarter inch, look at a ruler if your are unsure (I actually have a kitchen-dedicated ruler hanging close to 
            my cutting board). If you hold your knife at an angle of about 60-degrees, you'll get a nice diagonal cut that makes your carrots and celery a bit
            longer (this isn't necessary for this recipe as the cooking method is boiling, but it's good to know and practice, especially for recipes that require 
            a wok for the cooking method). Cut away the large vein from each cabbage leaf (it's usually too thick to fully cook in this recipe), discard it, 
            and slice your cabbage into ribbons about 1/8 inch thick. Toss your cut veggies and 1/2 half of the Ramen noodle flavor pack in a large pot and use
            cool water to cover the vegetables. Use enough water so that you have about 1/2 inch of water above the top of the vegetable layer.</p>

            <p>Turn your stover burner to high, and wait until the water comes to a rolling boil. Now drop in your Ramen noodles (I usually crack the raw noodle 
            block in half first because I like shorter noodles). Without mixing or disturbing the vegetables, poke the noodles down into the water with a
            spoon or fork (be careful of the steam) for about 30 seconds, or until they soften and spread out so that they are fully emersed in the 
            boiling water. Continue cooking the vegetables and noodles for the amount of time listed on the Ramen package.</p>

            <p>Turn off the stove. If you don't want to eat all of the liquid left in the pot, now is the time to drain some off. Add the other half
            of the Ramen seasoning pack and mix well. Now add the carmelized onions. A couple tablespoons will give you a nice flavor, but you can add 
            as much as you like. The heat in the soup will warm them up just fine. </p>

            <p>NOTE: If you want a vegetable that has a long cook time, such as raw potatoes, cut them into small dice and fully cook them before adding 
            the ramen noodles. If you want to add canned vegetables, such as corn or peas, add them at the very end to heat them through.
            Frozen vegetables also work just fine, add them to the cold water, boil for a minute or two, and stick a fork in them to test if they
            are soft enough. Remember that you still need to boil the noodles for about 3 minutes, so if you're afraid that your vegetables are already too
            cooked to handle the extra time, you can pull them out with a slotted spoon and set them aside.</p>

    <h4>Toppings and Mix-Ins</h4>
    <p>honey mustard, mayonnaise, deviled eggs (if you dont want to chop, a few buzzes with an emulsifier would be awesome, but use less), </p>
