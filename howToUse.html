    <h4>Storing and Freezing</h4>
    <p>Caramelized onions will transform the flavor of everything you put them in or on. They store well if covered and placed in the refrigerator for up to a week.
        Of course, you can make them once a week, they are absolutely worth the time and the tears required, and you'll hone your knife skills to boot, but 
        this can quickly start to feel like a chore. A great solution is to just freeze them. Freezing and thawing won't change the texture significantly, and the 
        flavor will just as delicious. An ice cube tray will freeze small, individual portions, which allows you to add a couple tablespoons at a time. Just
        be aware that the onion flavor may permeate the tray even after washing, and as I assume you don't want to drink onion-infused iced tea, you won't
        want to use that tray for ice cubes again. *TEST FREEZING IN GLAD BOWL AND PLASTIC-WRAPPED PLATE*

    <h4>The extra oil</h4>
    <p>Explain that if the oil tastes weak (closer to unused oil out of a bottle) then use it with abandonment to cook with, but if it tastes strong
        then use it as a flavoring agent, like replacing the oil in homemade salad dressings, or hummus. Explain that no matter if the flavor is weak or strong,
        always adjust for the added salt.

    <h4>Toppings and Mix-Ins</h4>
    <p>honey mustard, mayonnaise, deviled eggs (if you dont want to chop, a few buzzes with an emulsifier would be awesome, but use less), </p>
