    <h4>Storing and Freezing</h4>
    <p>Caramelized onions will transform the flavor of everything you put them in or on. They store well if covered and placed in the refrigerator for up to a week.
        Of course, you can make them once a week, they are absolutely worth the time and the tears required, and you'll hone your knife skills to boot, but 
        this can quickly start to feel like a chore. A great solution is to just freeze them. Freezing and thawing won't change the texture significantly, and the 
        flavor will just as delicious. An ice cube tray will freeze small, individual portions, which allows you to add a couple of tablespoons at a time. Just
        be aware that the onion flavor may permeate the tray even after washing, and as I assume you don't want to drink onion-infused iced tea, you won't
        want to use that tray for regular ice cubes again. I like freezing them in 4 oz mason jelly jars, but zipper sandwich bags work well. Just place the bag on a plate, 
        or in a cup, until frozen, just in case it leaks.
    </p>
    <h4>The extra oil</h4>
    <p> Extra caramelized onion oil is a delicious addition to recipes. I prefer to use it without any extra cooking as a flavoring agent for finished dishes, or in
        uncooked dishes that call for oil, such as salad dressing, or hummus.

        While you can cook with it for quick recipes, such as grilled cheese or eggs, be careful cooking with it for extended periods because it will become bitter. Always 
        remember to adjust for the salt that is already incorporated into the caramelized onion oil.

        If you find that you like this oil, and want extra, just add as much as you want to have leftover to the oil that the caramelized onion recipes call for.
        It doesn't change anything except give you extra.

    <h4>Toppings and Mix-Ins</h4>
    <p>There are so many of these, so I'll just list the ones I make consistantly: honey mustard, mayonnaise, deviled eggs (if you dont want to chop
        the onions into small pieces just use an emulsifier, or stick blender. On top of hot dogs, or hamburgers, or deli meat sandwiches (toast the bread and put the onions in
        between the slices to give them a bit of warmth. Add them to cornbread before baking, or after as a topping instead of butter or jam. Heat them up and toss them with 
        lettuce to slightly wilt the greens for a warm salad</p>
