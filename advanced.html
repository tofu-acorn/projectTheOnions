*1* Begin by preparing all onions to be sliced. Cut one end off an onion. I
prefer to cut off the stem end, the one with the little hairs, so that I don't
end up with those hairs on my cutting board later. Place the cut side down on
the cutting board and slice the onion through the middle to have two equal
pieces. Now peel the two halves. Repeat with all onions. Place your pan on the
stove, set the heat to medium, and add the oil. Now, slice 3 onions into 1/4
inch half moons and add them to the pan. Stir until the onions are coated in
oil. Continue to cut, add, and stir in batches of 3 until all of the onions are
in the pan. Add the salt and stir well. After prepping your onions, turn heat to
medium-high and add the oil. Add about half of the onions along with the salt
and stir well for about 10 seconds. Now add the rest of the onions and stir
again until they are well coated in oil and salt. *2* Turn the heat to medium
high and cover the pan, leaving the lid askew. Turn the heat down to medium low,
and cook for 25 minutes. NOTE: This heats the onions from the top down, which
will expel their liquid quicker. Leaving the lid askew will allow the liquid to
evaporate. If you don't have a lid, you can set a cookie sheet or an oven-safe
frying pan partially over the pan. Aluminum foil will work here too, just shape
the foil over the pan and then pull two of the sides a few inches away from the
edges. Please remember to do this before the pan is hot. *3* After 25 minutes,
carefully remove the lid to avoid the steam. Stir the onions well, about 20
seconds, turn heat to low. The onions will most likely have begun to brown, but
if not, don't worry. They will soon. Cook, uncovered and undisturbed, for
another 15 minutes. *4* Now begin stirring the onions roughly every 5 minutes.
If you don't see any noticable color change, then just add a few minutes. If the
color drastically darkens after 5 minutes, then lower the heat. Do this 4 times,
for a total of about 20 minutes. *5* The onions should be much darker by now.
Stir them again, then pull a few out of the pan and allow them to cool. Taste
the cooled onions. If you enjoy the flavor then you can stop here. If you'd like
a stronger flavor with a darker appearance, continue cooking, stirring, and
tasting at 5 minutes intervals at the same heat level, just like in the step
above. You can continue cooking this way for a long while, until the onions are
almost as dark as chocolate. NOTE: The longer the onions are carmelized, the
more they develop an almost nutty flavor. Many people love that flavor, so
please experiment. As I am not fond of that flavor, I finished cooking mine
after an extra 10 minutes.
