<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<section>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lbs onions, yellow preferred</li>
        <li>1/4 cup canola oil, more if you want extra oil for other recipes</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<h1>Instructions</h1>

<section>
    <ol>
        <li>After prepping your onions, turn heat to
            medium-high and add the oil. Add about half of the onions along with the salt
            and stir well for about 10 seconds. Now add the rest of the onions and stir
            again until they are well coated in oil and salt.</li><br>
        <li>Cover the pan, leaving the lid askew. Turn the heat down to medium low,
            and cook for 25 minutes. 
            </li><br>
        <li>After 25 minutes,
            carefully remove the lid to avoid the steam. Stir the onions well,
            turn heat to low. <i>NOTE: The onions will most likely have begun to brown, but
            if not, don't worry. They will soon. Cook, uncovered and undisturbed, for
            another 15 minutes.</i></li><br>
        <li>Now begin stirring the onions roughly every 5 minutes.
            If you don't see any noticable color change, then just add a few minutes. If the
            color drastically darkens after 5 minutes, then lower the heat. Do this 4 times,
            for a total of about 20 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>The onions should be much darker by now.
            Stir them again, then pull a few out of the pan and allow them to cool. Taste
            the cooled onions. If you enjoy the flavor then you can stop here. If you'd like
            a stronger flavor with a darker appearance, continue cooking, stirring, and
            tasting at 5 minutes intervals at the same heat level, just like in the step
            above. You can continue cooking this way for a long while, until the onions are
            almost as dark as chocolate. <i>NOTE: The longer the onions are carmelized, the
            more they develop an almost nutty flavor. Many people love that flavor, so
            please experiment. As I am not fond of that flavor, I finished cooking mine
            after an extra 10 minutes.</i></li><br>
